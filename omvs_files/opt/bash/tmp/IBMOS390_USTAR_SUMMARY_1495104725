# Archive Name: bash-4.3_b018.170518.tar
#
# This file was created by the IBM z/OS pax or tar utility.
# During the process of creating the archive from which this
# file was extracted, one or more of the source files to be
# stored in the archive was determined to have names or
# attributes that are not supported by the standard USTAR
# format (as described by POSIX.2 IEEE std 1003.2-1992).
# To preserve these files or these characteristics,
# one or more special header files (having the same name as
# this file) were inserted into the archive.  Those files
# are recognized by z/OS pax and tar utilities and are
# used during extraction to restore the files to their
# original state.
#
# The purpose of this file is to summarize the information
# described by all z/OS special header files stored in
# the archive so that users with versions of pax or tar
# that do not support these special header files can
# manually restore some or all of the files and file
# attributes described by them.  Note that some file
# attributes are specific to z/OS and cannot be restored
# on other platforms.
#
# The remainder of this file consists of a set of records
# corresponding to each special header file stored in the
# archive.  Each set consists of a record describing the
# pathname, one or more reasons explaining why the file or
# attribute could not be stored, and the unix command,
# or commands, that would be used to restore the file or
# attribute.  Note that these commands use the pathnames
# of the file as they existed when archived and may not
# correspond to the current pathnames on your system.
